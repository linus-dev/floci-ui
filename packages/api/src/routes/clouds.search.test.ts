/**
 * Regression tests for issue #205:
 * "Search bar in top nav doesn't update the `search` query param"
 *
 * These tests verify that the `GET /clouds/:cloud/services/:service/resources`
 * route correctly reads the `search` URL query parameter and forwards it to
 * `CloudProxyService.listResources()` as `query.search`.
