/**
 * Maps the server's `iconKey` hint to a component.
 *
 * Icon keys are additive and never load-bearing: the server can ship a service
 * whose key this build has never heard of, and the nav must still render. Passing
 * `undefined` as a JSX component throws and — before the ErrorBoundary lands —
 * would blank the whole app, so the fallback is not optional.
